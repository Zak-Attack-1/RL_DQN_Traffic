# RL_DQN_Traffic
This project uses Deep Q-Learning to optimize traffic flow at a highway ramp intersection in a SUMO simulation. A custom Gym environment and DQN model adapt traffic lights dynamically, reducing vehicle wait times by 30%. Future work includes scaling, real-world data integration, and advanced RL methods.
